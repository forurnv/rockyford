	-The website landing page is in essence a 3 viewport length hero-about-us page.
We’re going to follow the convention attempted but with a modern look of background gallery 
			<call-to-action-in-content-somewhere: 
Rockyford Campground espresso info>
and divide the long history into sub-themes to elude to the multiple hero banner page in order to update the feel by adding a newer convention or the latest accepted one.

	-Finally, the footer is the most current development as it comprises the growing convention of the ¾ hero menu with all the trimmings. (social links that have unreadable content, legal Address, link-looking-non-links, super-link-looking-non-links, map feature (that will be going to the top), back to top button, log-in?!?!, current-but-not-current-weather(10deg-off)). We’ll make it look professional.
